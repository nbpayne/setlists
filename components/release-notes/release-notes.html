<!-- Set Lists --> <section id="set-list"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-8"><!-- Title --> <h1> Release Notes </h1> <dl> <dt>0.24.0 FEATURE Tour the app to learn how to use it</dt> <dd>You can now learn about how to use the app by clicking the `?` icon in the top right of the screen.</dd> <dt>0.23.1 BUGFIX Can't login from an older browser</dt> <dd>Some folks couldn't login because one line of code had a word in it that is only supported by really, really new browsers. I changed it to a different, less exciting word, that all browsers understand.</dd> <dt>0.23.0 FEATURE Share your set list with others</dt> <dd>When viewing a set list you can now click the `Share` icon to get a unique URL that you can use to share the set list with others. They are able to view the set list, but not edit it.</dd> <dt>0.22.0 IMPROVEMENT Gigs today that have already started still appear in the `Upcoming Gigs` list</dt> <dd>If you looked at your gig one minute after it started it was appearing in the `Past Gigs` list. Now it won't move there until tomorrow.</dd> <dt>0.21.2 BUGFIX Clicking '+' to add song adds wrong song</dt> <dd>Crazy JavaScript thing where songs weren't in alphabetical order under the hood.</dd> <dt>0.21.1 BUGFIX Fix small error in HTML</dt> <dd>It wasn't valid OK.</dd> <dt>0.21.0 FEATURE Ask politely for users email address via Facebook so we can keep in contact</dt> <dd>When joining, Facebook asks if it's OK to supply us with your email address. You email address will help us keep in contact with you about what's going on.</dd> <dt>0.20.0 FEATURE Add release-notes page</dt> <dd>Visit `/release-notes` to find out about the latest changes to the app.</dd> <dt>0.19.2 BUGFIX Can't login</dt> <dd>Fix accidental infinite loop introduced in last release.</dd> <dt>0.19.1 IMPROVEMENT Change log errors to warnings</dt> <dd>Log entries concerning failure to connect to the API are now logged as `warnings` rather than `errors`.</dd> <dt>0.19.0 FEATURE Log JavaScript errors</dt> <dd>So that we can find and squash bugs quickly, critical errors are now logged to the server.</dd> <dt>0.18.0 IMPROVEMENT Tweak font sizes</dt> <dd>Tweak the font sizes to make them a little smaller. This way they're a great size for both the desktop and on mobile.</dd> <dt>0.17.0 IMPROVEMENT Hide the song list when printing</dt> <dd>Hid the song list when you print as song list &ndash; why would you want that anyway?</dd> <dt>0.16.0 IMPROVEMENT Make the set-list edit button bigger</dt> <dd>Make the set-list edit button bigger so it's easy to click with fat fingers on a mobile screen.</dd> <dt>0.15.0 FEATURE Handle 401s from API and force logout.</dt> <dd>If the server says you're not authorized, then the app now logs you out so you can log back in again and be authorised. Previously it was ignoring this and you could change stuff without it being saved to the server.</dd> <dt>0.14.0 FEATURE Add spinners to show progress whilst loading from API / Make font-size bigger in `set-lists` view</dt> <dd>The server responds fast &mdash; I mean, in like 500ms &mdash; but this short wait can still give the impression that something is not working. The app now shows spinners whilst it connects to the server so that you know it's doing something.</dd> <dt>0.13.2 BUGFIX Calendar field not rendering full width on iOS Chrome &ndash; try and change field type from 'datetime-local' to 'text'</dt> <dd>The calendar field was rendering wierdly on mobile. This was because the iPhone was treating it as a date/time field and trying to open it's native date/time picker. Changing the field type to text and making the field read-only now means the field renders correctly, and clicking on it opens our custom date/time picker.</dd> <dt>0.13.1 BUGIX Logout redirecting user to root of site when site served from a subfolder &ndash; deactivate for now</dt> <dd>When you logout in production you're landing in the wrong spot and getting a 404 page. This is because the site is being served from a subfolder. I tried to fix this, and couldn't find a fix yet. For now I've deactivated the login feature. In the future I'll move the site out of the subfolder into the root of the site, so this won't be a problem again.</dd> <dt>0.13.0/0.13.1 Get Facebook login working brilliantly</dt> <dd>Facebook login is now working brilliantly. No errors on Chrome for mobile from it trying to open the Facebook login page in a new window.</dd> <dt>0.12.1 BUGFIX: Songs not dragging. Force `angular` to load before `query` / BUGFIX: Remove button not clicking</dt> <dd>Fix craziness!</dd> <dt>0.12.0 FEATURE Display the current version</dt> <dd>Display the current version of the app in the top navbar. This allows you to know which version you have loaded and make sure you're on the latest.</dd> <dt>0.11.0 REFACTOR Complete refactor of app to use Bootstrap</dt> <dd>Previously the app was built using Foundation. It looked great. Unfortunately, third party components like date/time pickers were hard to find. Moving to Bootstrap has given us access to a lot more third party components and now we have a working date/time picker! I also restructured the app code to make it easier to work on.</dd> <dt>0.1.0-0.10.0 Initial alpha version</dt> <dd>This was the initial alpha version of the app. Too many changes to go into here.</dd> </dl> </div> </div></section>
